# **How to Properly Log Process Creation with Event ID 4688**  

### **Why Even Bother with This?**  
Let’s be real event logs can be a mess. There’s way too much data, and no one expects you to memorize every event ID. But what if you could track most of the important stuff with just **one** event ID? That’s where **Event ID 4688** in the **Security** event logs comes in.  

Most orgs don’t configure their event logging properly,they just roll with the default settings, which kinda sucks. Luckily, **Event ID 4688** captures a lot of **useful security data**, like:  
**Parent Process** (what started it)  
**Child Process** (what was created)  
**Command line arguments** (if configured)  

Yeah, it can be **super noisy**, but if you configure it right, it becomes a **solid tool for process tracking**. If you already have **Sysmon** or an **EDR solution**, you don’t **need** to do this—but hey, it’s fun to play around with.

## **How to Set Up Event ID 4688 Logging**  

### **Step 1: Open Group Policy Editor**  
First, make sure your system **supports** Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`). It’s available on **Windows Pro, Enterprise, and higher**—but **not on Windows Home editions**.  

### **Step 2: Enable Process Creation Auditing**  
Now, let’s turn on logging for process creation:  
1.Open **Group Policy Editor** (`gpedit.msc`).  
2.Go to:  
   **Computer Configuration** → **Windows Settings** → **Security Settings** → **Advanced Audit Policy Configuration** → **System Audit Policies** → **Detailed Tracking**  
3️.Find **Audit Process Creation** → Click **Configure the following audit events**.  
4️.Check **both**:  
   - **Success**  (logs successful process creation)  
   - **Failure**  (logs failed attempts)  
5️.Click **Apply** and **OK**.  

### **Step 3: Enable Command-Line Logging**  
To actually see what commands were run, you gotta **enable command-line logging**:  
1️.Go to:  
   **Computer Configuration** → **Administrative Templates** → **System**  
2️.Click on **Audit Process Creation**.  
3️.Open **Include command line in process creation events**.  
4️.Set it to **Enabled** → Click **Apply** and **OK**.

## **How to Check If It’s Working**  
Now, let’s **see if you did everything right**:  
🔹 Open **PowerShell** and run some basic commands that should trigger logs:  
```powershell
net user
net localgroup
whoami
ipconfig
tasklist
```
(These interact with system processes, so they should show up in logs.)  

🔹 Open **Event Viewer** (`eventvwr.msc`).  
🔹 Go to **Windows Logs** → **Security**.  
🔹 Filter by **Event ID 4688** (or just scroll through).  
🔹 Look for entries where the **process name** is `powershell.exe` or `net.exe`.  
🔹 Check if the **command-line arguments** match what you ran.  

**Bonus:** Want to test more? Run commands like `whoami`, `netstat`, or `sc query` and see if they get logged. You’ll notice that **not everything gets captured**, but most commands interacting with processes will be there.

## **Final Thoughts**  
Event ID 4688 is **one of the most useful logs** when it comes to process monitoring. If you don’t have an advanced logging solution like Sysmon, **this is the next best thing**. Once configured properly, it helps track process execution and detect suspicious activity **without installing anything extra**.  

Yeah, it can be noisy, but **with proper filtering**, it becomes an extremely valuable security tool.  

Now go test it out and see what’s happening on your system!
